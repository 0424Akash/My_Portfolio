                        As a data engineer, my objective is to utilize my expertise in designing, building and maintaining data pipelines, and programming languages like Python to create scalable data solutions. With experience in Flask for building APIs, MySQL and Neo4j for data storage and retrieval, and AWS for cloud computing. As part of a project, I designed and implemented ETL processes for data migration and developed data models to optimize database performance. My dedication to delivering high-quality work and my passion for continuous learning and growth make me an asset to any team.

                <p>
                    During my internship as a data engineer, I had the opportunity to work on various aspects of the data pipeline, including extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from MySQL database to neo4j database. I primarily used Python to build scripts for ETL processes and used technologies such as MySQL and Neo4j for data storage and retrieval. I also worked on creating APIs to allow for seamless data access for clients and generated reports based on their specific needs. My role involved handling the complete ETL process, from data extraction to storage, and ensuring that the data was accurate, consistent, and accessible. The experience allowed me to strengthen my technical skills and understand the importance of data management in a business environment. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with a team of experienced data professionals and contribute to the successful implementation of data projects.

                I am proud to have accomplished several achievements in my personal and academic life. I participated in an inter-college pencil sketch competition and demonstrated my artistic abilities. Additionally, I was part of a group of students who went to assist those affected by the floods in Karnataka and helped distribute necessary requirements to those in need. I also had the opportunity to participate in a workshop held at IIIT Hyderabad, where I was able to expand my knowledge and skills. Furthermore, I took part in a hackathon held at IIT Dharwad and was able to collaborate with a team to develop innovative solutions. I am proud to have placed 8th in the hackathon and I am looking forward to participating in more such events in the future. These experiences have allowed me to showcase my talents, give back to my community, and grow both personally and professionally.

                            Preventing SQL injection attacks is possible by anticipating and neutralizing potentially harmful SQL statements before they are executed. Our method of choice is the use of Random Decision Forest, which has demonstrated outstanding results in mitigating SQLi attacks, with a 95% accuracy and 97% precision rate.

                            The purpose of this research is to explore the possibility of predicting Ventricular Tachycardia Arrhythmia (VTA) early through the use of features extracted from QRS complexes. We have analyzed two characteristics, the QRS signed area and R-peak amplitude, and evaluated the VTA prediction accuracy using various machine learning techniques.

                        <p>
                            This project aims to classify wedding images based on different regions of the world using a new approach. It utilizes UNet and a modified VGG network for segmentation and classification, with the VGG network being modified by adding Inception blocks and Residual networks. Transfer learning was used on the Cifar 10 dataset before fine-tuning for the wedding image dataset and various classifiers were added to the model, with the artificial neural network being the best choice for most classifications. However, for some classifications where the dataset was smaller, traditional machine learning models like SVM and Random Forest were used. The testing data showed an accuracy of 85.96% for Indian vs International images and 83.64% for North India vs South India classification with Random Forest as the best classifier. This project showcases the potential to use image information for classification and can be extended to other fields of research.
